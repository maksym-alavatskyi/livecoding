# Technical Test: Database Query Optimization

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Execute `node index.js` to run the suboptimal query against the SQLite database.
5. Optimize the provided SQL query in the `index.js` file and explain your solution.

## Task

Your task is to optimize the SQL query provided in `index.js` to improve performance.

- Consider techniques like indexing, query refactoring, or aggregation.
- Provide a brief explanation of the optimizations you applied.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Effectiveness of the optimizations.
- Clarity in explaining the rationale behind the chosen methods.
- Understanding of SQL and database performance considerations.
